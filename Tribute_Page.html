                Welcome to Veteran Tributes!  Our goal is to pay tribute to all military personnel, from every service branch, and from every time period in American History.  These are the brave men and women that have sacrificed to keep this nation free for the last 239 years and they deserve our respect.  On this site you will find tribute pages for Medal of Honor Recipients, Prisoners of War, Generals and Admirals, as well as the Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, and Marines that nobody has ever heard of...they all performed honorable service to this nation, and many of them gave their life to keep us free.

                A tribute to Veterans has bought together honourable veterans, influential business leaders and dedicated supporters of the veteran community for the last 24 years to celebrate the great achievements of local veterans and to remember the brave men and women we have lost during their time of service.

              <p class="quotes">
                "War is an ugly thing, but not the ugliest of things. The decayed and degraded state of moral and patriotic feeling which thinks that nothing is worth war is much worse. The person who has nothing for which he is willing to fight, nothing which is more important than his own personal safety, is a miserable creature and has no chance of being free unless made and kept so by the exertions of better men than himself."
